                    <li><h3>Comprehensive Village Surveys</h3><b>Conducted Surveys on Lifestyle and Needs: 
                    </b>We conducted thorough surveys in the villages to understand the residents' lifestyles, access to digital data, educational status, farm management practices, and water requirements. This comprehensive assessment provided valuable insights into the challenges faced by the villagers and helped in identifying areas that need immediate attention and intervention.</li>
                    <li><h3>Household Counseling</h3><b>Simultaneous Counseling During Surveys: 
                    </b>While conducting surveys, we also counseled the households on various aspects such as health, education, and sustainable farming practices. This dual approach not only gathered essential data but also empowered the villagers with knowledge and resources to improve their living conditions and make informed decisions.</li>
                    <li><h3>Teaching in Local Schools</h3><b>Educational Support in Local Schools:                     </b>For a tenure of 2 months, our team taught at three local schools, covering primary grades and grades 9 to 12. This initiative provided much-needed educational support, helping students enhance their learning and motivation. It also highlighted the importance of education in breaking the cycle of poverty and fostering a brighter future for the children.</li>
                    <li><h3>Support for Shelter-Cum-Schools</h3><b>Visited Shelter-Cum-School for Girls:
                    </b>We visited a shelter-cum-school for little girls, many of whom were abandoned or placed there by parents unable to afford their daily needs. Our presence and support provided the girls with care and attention, ensuring they received proper education and a safe environment. This initiative was crucial in safeguarding their rights and promoting their well-being.</li>
                    <li><h3>Agricultural Assistance</h3><b>Assisting Farmers on Strawberry Farms: 
                    </b>We were placed to visit and assist farmers with fieldwork on strawberry farms. This hands-on support helped farmers adopt better farming techniques and improve crop yields. By directly engaging in farm activities, we contributed to enhancing agricultural productivity and sustainability, thereby supporting the local economy and food security.</li>
