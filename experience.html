            <h2>Experience of Working on the Farm</h2>
            <div class="content">
                <p>

                    Taking a break from the city hustle and immersing ourselves in the rural air was both refreshing and exhilarating. Our team visited a strawberry farm to understand and support the life of a farmer. The experience of "languages changing per mile in India" brought to life the diversity we had learned about in school.</p>
                    
        
                    The farm, with its rows of lush strawberry plants and the sweet fragrance of ripe berries, welcomed us warmly. We spent time with the shelter girls and farmers, offering guidance while learning invaluable lessons from their resilience and unwavering smiles despite the challenges they faced. Their positive spirit was truly inspiring.
                    
                     One of the most touching aspects of our visit was meeting their children, who were excelling in traditional arts like Warli painting and playing tribal musical instruments such as the pawri and thali at the national level. Their achievements were a testament to their dedication and talent, and it filled us with admiration.
                    
                    <p> We engaged in various tasks on the farm, from planting to watering, gaining hands-on experience and a profound appreciation for the hard work involved in strawberry cultivation. The physical labor was demanding, but the satisfaction of contributing made it worthwhile.</p>
                    
                    At the end of the day, the farmers graciously served us baskets of freshly picked strawberries. The taste was unparalleled, a perfect blend of sweetness and accomplishment. This visit not only enriched our understanding of rural life but also deepened our respect for the farmers' relentless efforts and their rich cultural heritage.</p>
